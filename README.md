# Bike Sharing
> This project is about building a regression model to predict the number of bike rental base on different features like weather, season, etc. The company wants to be ready for the future demand and provide the enough number of bikes to their customers but also, they are looking to maximize their profit by reducing cost.

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- The company has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- The copmpany aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- The company has historic data from 2018, and 2019 about the number of bikes rentals as well other information like date of the rentals and weather condition on thaes dates. In this model we are using this information to predict the bike rentals demand in the future.

## Conclusions
- Temprature is a very important factor that can contribute in defining the demand of the bikes rental, as the temprature gets higher the demand increases. Correlation of 0.7 and a high coefficient of the variable in the model proves it.
- the demand is increasing over years as we compare 2018 to 2019, the demand is expected to increase after the COVID-19 pandamic.
- Rainy weather is effecting the demand on bikes rentals. In rainy days the demand is lower compare to clear or cloudy days.
